      how_get_hired_title: How do I get hired?
      how_get_hired_content10: Build a winning profile
      how_get_hired_content20: "Our clients are looking for trustworthy service professionals who can demonstrate relevant experience to their specific needs. Your Hizmetkutusu profile is where your potential clients meet you and your business. Add a profile picture - preferably one where we clearly see your handsome smiling face. Describe your experience: what jobs have you done in the past? Why are you the right person to hire? Make yourself trustworthy; update a license, link to your website or LinkedIn. And most importantly, wow them with with photos and videos - let them imagine you doing the job!"
      how_get_hired_content30: Talk with a client clearly and professionally
      how_get_hired_content40: This is your chance to tell who you are to potential client. Make sure to personalize - focus on addressing any issues the client raised and responding to their specific request. If you need more information, try asking to clarify. Set a competitive price (always helps make a good impression), and finally, go over briefly your qualifications and specialties.
      how_get_hired_content50: Give an estimate
      how_get_hired_content60: Customers are more likely to hire service providers who provide a basic idea of price. Whenever possible, give your customers a sense of cost. This does not have to be the final number, and it can be changed as you learn more about a particular job.
      how_get_hired_content70: Get ratings and increase your hizmetkutusu score
      how_get_hired_content80: Clients tell us that Hizmetkutusu score is a major factor in their decision of who to hire. Ask your consumers to give you ratings. Make sure your ratings are credible - not everyone is perfect 100% of the time.
      how_get_hired_content90: "Don't give up!" 
      how_get_hired_content100: "Even our most successful service providers may not have gotten hired on their first quote. Remember, because there are up to three quotes submitted per request and client may not be sure what he wants; you will not win every single job. It takes time to meet the right customer for you. Make sure you are receiving the right leads. Try freely talking with clients. Experiment and see what works. For a majority of providers, it takes more than 5 quotes to get their first hire. Treat this as an investment in your long term success. Many service providers have grown their business more than 50% by simply responding consistently to Hizmetkutusu leads. You can too."

      aboutus_290: Sabah 7 akşam 7,
      aboutus_300: Haftanın 6 günü,
      aboutus_310: Üretmeli,
      aboutus_320: Ürettikleri hiçbir işe yaramayan hırdavatı,
      aboutus_330: Emeklerinin karşılarında aldıkları ücretlerle,
      aboutus_340: Yine kendileri tüketmelidirler.
      aboutus_350: Enayilerin sadece bir kısmı çok çalışırlar.
      aboutus_360: Ama bütün enayiler çalışkanlığı överler.
      aboutus_370: Çalışmak anayasalara hak olarak girmiştir.
      aboutus_380: Liderlerin halklarına söyledikleri ilk şey olmuştur.
      aboutus_390: Dünyaya bugüne kadar gelmiş ve geçmiş;
      aboutus_400: Tüm sistemlerin,
      aboutus_410: Tüm akımların,
      aboutus_420: Tüm dinlerin,
      aboutus_430: Tüm inançların,
      aboutus_440: Tek bir ortak yanı vardır.
      aboutus_450: Çalışmak.
      aboutus_460: Çalışmak ne bir hak, ne bir ödevdir.
      aboutus_470: Kötü bir kaderdir sadece.
      aboutus_480: En kötü cinsten köleliktir.
      aboutus_490: Sefilliktir.
      aboutus_500: Büyük talihsizliktir.
      aboutus_510: Para; güvenlik, konfor, özgürlük ve yer yer mutluluk getirir.
      aboutus_520: Ama ne fakirlerin hayal ettikleri,
      aboutus_530: Ne de zenginlerin uğrunda yaşamlarını harcadıkları kadar.
      aboutus_540: Çalışan milyonların kendilerine soramadıkları,
      aboutus_550: Veya sormaya cesaret edemedikleri,
      aboutus_560: Büyük soru şudur;
      aboutus_570: Zamanımızın hemen hemen hepsini,
      aboutus_580: Bedenimizin önemli bir kısmını,
      aboutus_590: Duygularımızın ve düşüncelerimizin neredeyse yarısını,
      aboutus_600: Elden çıkararak kazandığımız tam olarak nedir?
      aboutus_610: Çalışkanlar, akıllı tüccarlar gibi düşünselerdi,
      aboutus_620: Çalışmaktan vazgeçebilirlerdi.
      aboutus_630: Çünkü akıllı tüccarlar,
      aboutus_640: Ellerindeki iyi bir şeyi,
      aboutus_650: Ancak daha değerli bir başkası için çıkartırlar.
      aboutus_660: Peki.
      aboutus_670: Elimizdeki en iyi şey nedir?
      aboutus_680: Yaşamdır.
      aboutus_690: Yaşamak da, Çalışmak değildir.
      aboutus_700: Sadece enayiler, yaşamak için çalışmak gerektiğini düşünürler.
      aboutus_710: Yaşamak, Çalışmak Değildir!
      aboutus_720: Ya nedir?
      aboutus_730: Boş boş bulutları seyretmektir,
      aboutus_740: Takla atmaktır,
      aboutus_750: Yuvarlanmaktır,
      aboutus_760: Kanatlanmaktır,
      aboutus_770: Dans etmektir,
      aboutus_780: Gözünü kırpmadan rezil olmaktır,
      aboutus_790: Kendinden geçmektir,
      aboutus_800: İçine gömülmektir.
      aboutus_810: Aşkla,
      aboutus_820: Şiirle,
      aboutus_830: Sohbetle,
      aboutus_840: Türlü türlü maceralar içinde,
      aboutus_850: Hayretten hayrete düşerek,
      aboutus_860: Şu kısacık ömrü,
      aboutus_870: İçinden geldiği gibi,
      aboutus_880: Geçirmektir.
      aboutus_890: Durmak.
      aboutus_900: Ve Düşünmektir.
      aboutus_910: Asıl bunlar, zaman ve emek isterler.
      aboutus_920: Çalışanlar sadece koşuştururlar.
      aboutus_930: İlerleyen insanlık - eğer ilerliyorsa,
      aboutus_940: Her şeyini aylaklara borçludur.
      aboutus_950: Evet aylaklara.
      aboutus_960: Bizler, Aylak İnsanlarız.
      aboutus_970: Kimdir Aylak?
      aboutus_980: Aylak, çabasız yaratan kişidir.
      aboutus_990: Yavaşça, Usulca, Kendiliğinden.
      aboutus_1000: Bütün büyük sanatçılar böyledir.
      aboutus_1010: İlim, sanat, kültür ve medeniyet dedikleri,
      aboutus_1020: Aylakların keyiflerinden arta kalan boş zamanlarında,
      aboutus_1030: Yavaş yavaş uydurdukları nafile hayallerle,
      aboutus_1040: Yaptıkları bomboş marifetlerdir.
      aboutus_1050: Aylaklar için yaşamak, harcayarak bitiremeyecekleri bir servettir.
      aboutus_1060: Çalışkanlar için yaşamak, bir cimrinin kuruşlarını sıkıştırdığı kumbarasıdır.
      aboutus_1070: Çabasız, emeksiz ve telaşsız elde edilemeyecek hiçbir lezzet yoktur.
      aboutus_1080: Bütün aylaklar bunun sırrını iyi bilirler.
      aboutus_1090: Bu nedenle;
      aboutus_1100: Ne istediğini bilen bir aylak,
      aboutus_1110: Ne istediğini bilmeyen bir çalışkandan,
      aboutus_1120: Daha çok şey yapar, yaşar ve yaratır.
      aboutus_1130: Aylak taslağı hayal eder.
      aboutus_1140: Çalışkanlar ise taşları üst üste koyarlar.
      aboutus_1150: Durduk.
      aboutus_1160: Ve Düşündük.
      aboutus_1170: Durduk.
      aboutus_1180: Ve Düşündük.
      aboutus_1190: Durduk.
      aboutus_1200: Ve Düşündük.
      aboutus_1210: Hizmetkutusunu kurduk.
      aboutus_1220: Hizmetkutusunun kurulma amacı;
      aboutus_1230: Sahip olmak yerine, hizmet almayı topluma yaymaktır.
      aboutus_1240: Bu amacını gerçekleştirmek için,
      aboutus_1250: Kaliteli hizmetin makul fiyata alınabilmesini sağlayacaktır.
      aboutus_1260: Neden mi?
      aboutus_1270: Çünkü, 
      aboutus_1280: Önemli olan hislerdir.
      aboutus_1290: Nasıl mı?
      aboutus_1300: Bilimsel olarak.
      aboutus_1310: Bilimsel olarak,
      aboutus_1320: Her insan,
      aboutus_1330: Beyninde oluşan alemi seyreder, 
      aboutus_1340: Beyninde oluşan alemi duyar,
      aboutus_1350: Beyninde oluşan alemi koklar, 
      aboutus_1360: Beyninde oluşan alemi tadar, 
      aboutus_1370: Beyninde oluşan aleme dokunur.
      aboutus_1380: Görme olayını ele alalım.
      aboutus_1390: Baktığımız cisimden gelen ışık demetleri,
      aboutus_1400: Gözün önündeki lensin içinden geçerek,
      aboutus_1410: Retinaya ters olarak düşerler.
      aboutus_1420: Retinada bu uyarılar elektrik sinyallerine dönüşür.
      aboutus_1430: Ardından bu elektrik sinyalleri, sinirler aracılığı ile,
      aboutus_1440: Beynin arka bölümündeki görme merkezine ulaşır.
      aboutus_1450: İşte burada,
      aboutus_1460: Elektrik sinyalleri bir dizi işlemden geçer,
      aboutus_1470: Görüntü olarak algılanır. 
      aboutus_1480: Yani görme olayı gerçekte, 
      aboutus_1490: Beynin arkasındaki,
      aboutus_1500: Küçük, 
      aboutus_1510: Işığın hiçbir şekilde giremediği,
      aboutus_1520: Kapkaranlık bir noktada yaşanır.
      aboutus_1530: Gören gözlerimiz değildir,
      aboutus_1540: Görüntü beynimizde oluşur.
      aboutus_1550: Beynimizin diğer noktalarında aynı şekilde oluşan,
      aboutus_1560: Başka olaylar da vardır.
      aboutus_1570: Duyma, Koklama, Tatma, Dokunma.
      aboutus_1580: Ne kadar gerçekçi olursa olsun,
      aboutus_1590: Dış dünya,
      aboutus_1600: Sadece,
      aboutus_1610: Beynimizin birer yorumudur.
      aboutus_1620: Dünyanın gerçek görüntüsünü gördüğümüze dair,
      aboutus_1630: Bizi ikna eden beş duyumuz, 
      aboutus_1640: Elektrik sinyallerinden mahrum kaldığında, 
      aboutus_1650: Dış dünya da ortadan kalkar.
      aboutus_1660: Biz dünyayı bizim dışımızda zannederiz. 
      aboutus_1670: Oysa, dünya herşeyiyle bizim içimizdedir. 
      aboutus_1680: Biz, dışımızda sandığımız dünyayı aslında içimizde, 
      aboutus_1690: Beynimizdeki küçücük bir noktada görürüz. 
      aboutus_1700: Burada anlattığımız,
      aboutus_1710: Her insanın üzerinde büyük bir ciddiyetle düşünmesi gereken,
      aboutus_1720: Çok önemli bir bilimsel gerçektir. 
      aboutus_1730: Çünkü bu gerçeği görmezden gelen her insan, 
      aboutus_1740: Ömrü boyunca küçücük bir noktada oluşan görüntüyü,
      aboutus_1750: Gerçek zannederek yanılmaktadır. 
      aboutus_1760: Beynindeki bir noktada oluşan maddelere sahip olduğunu zanneden kişi,
      aboutus_1770: Bu görüntülerden dolayı mutlu olur.
      aboutus_1780: Beynindeki bir noktada oluşan maddelere sahip olmadığını zanneden kişi,
      aboutus_1790: Bu görüntülerden dolayı mutsuz olur.
      aboutus_1800: Bu maddelerin aslını, dışarıdaki gerçek halini,
      aboutus_1810: Hiç kimse, hiçbir zaman bilemez ve göremez. 
      aboutus_1820: Peki.
      aboutus_1830: Gören gözlerimiz değilse, 
      aboutus_1840: Gördüğü manzaradan zevk alan kimdir? 
      aboutus_1850: Hayatı boyunca, 
      aboutus_1860: Kapkaranlık, sessiz kafatasının içinde,
      aboutus_1870: Kendisine gösterilen görüntüleri;
      aboutus_1880: İzleyen, 
      aboutus_1890: Düşünen, 
      aboutus_1900: Sonuç çıkaran, 
      aboutus_1910: Karar veren,
      aboutus_1920: ve hisseden kimdir?
      aboutus_1930: Materyalistlerin içinden çıkamadıkları,
      aboutus_1940: Asıl nokta işte burasıdır.
      aboutus_1950: Çevremizde gördüğümüz herşeyle birlikte, 
      aboutus_1960: Biz de bir görüntüysek.
      aboutus_1970: Yani beynimiz de,
      aboutus_1980: Bir görüntü ise; 
      aboutus_1990: Görüntü olan bir varlığın,
      aboutus_2000: Görüntü meydana getirdiğini,
      aboutus_2010: Söyleyemeyiz. 
      aboutus_2020: O zaman bu görüntüleri kesintisiz olarak devam ettiren kimdir?
      aboutus_2030: Din, “Ruh” der.
      aboutus_2040: Felsefe, “Ruh” der.
      aboutus_2050: Bilim de sonunda “Ruh” der.
      aboutus_2060: Hep “Ruh” deniliyorsa,
      aboutus_2070: Bir bildikleri vardır.
      aboutus_2080: Bizim de bir bildiğimiz var.
      aboutus_2090: Biz görsek de görmesek de maddesel bir dünya vardır. 
      aboutus_2100: Ancak biz bu dünyayı beynimizin içinde bir kopya,
      aboutus_2110: Diğer bir deyişle algılarımızın yorumu olarak görürüz.
      aboutus_2120: Dolayısıyla madde, bizim için bir hayaldir.
      aboutus_2130: Önemli olan ruhumuz sayesinde hissettiklerimizdir.
      aboutus_2140: Madde bir hayalse,
      aboutus_2150: Önemli olan da hissetmekse,
      aboutus_2160: Niye hisler için değil de,
      aboutus_2170: Hayaller için yaşamımızı harcıyoruz?
      aboutus_2180: Maddeye sahip olmak,
      aboutus_2190: Anlamsız bir hayale sahip olmaktır.
      aboutus_2200: Fakat,
      aboutus_2210: Hisse sahip olmak için,
      aboutus_2220: Maddeye sahip olmamıza gerek yok ki.
      aboutus_2230: Dini, felsefi ve bilimsel olarak;
      aboutus_2240: Bir eve sahip olmak hem anlamsız hem gereksizdir.
      aboutus_2250: Bir arabaya sahip olmak hem anlamsız hem gereksizdir.
      aboutus_2260: Bir cep telefonuna sahip olmak hem anlamsız hem gereksizdir.
      aboutus_2265: Ama gerekiyorsa;
      aboutus_2270: Bu temel ihtiyaçların bile hislerini,
      aboutus_2280: Yaşamımızdan çok daha az vererek,
      aboutus_2290: Daha kaliteli bir halde,
      aboutus_2300: Daha makul fiyata,
      aboutus_2310: Yaşayabiliriz.
      aboutus_2320: Önemli olan da yaşamaktır!
      aboutus_2330: Nasıl mı?
      aboutus_2340: Hizmet Alarak.
      aboutus_2350: Her nesne, içine gömülü hizmetlerle kullanıcısına ulaşır.
      aboutus_2360: Oluşturulmasında, çeşitli kişilerden hizmet alınmıştır.
      aboutus_2370: Bu hizmetlerin sonucu, kullananın alacağı hizmeti belirler.
      aboutus_2380: Araba, sürücüsüne ulaşım hizmetleri sağlar.
      aboutus_2390: Ev, içinde yaşayan aileye yaşam hizmetleri sunar. 
      aboutus_2400: Telefon, kullanıcısına İletişim hizmetleri verir.
      aboutus_2410: Nesne olan araba, ev ve telefon birer araçtır, 
      aboutus_2420: Amaç, kişinin çeşitli hizmetlerini karşılamaktır.
      aboutus_2430: Çünkü kişi kendisini iyi hissetmek istiyordur.
      aboutus_2440: Zengin-fakir, Emir veren-emir alan. Genç-Yaşlı. Kadın-Erkek.
      aboutus_2450: Bugün herkes tüketmeye çalıştığı nesnelerin,
      aboutus_2460: Üretiminde çalıştırılarak tüketilen birer nesnedir.
      aboutus_2470: Biri iki milyon liralık bir villa için çalıştırılmaktadır,
      aboutus_2480: Diğeri ise iki bin liralık kullanılmış bir araba için. 
      aboutus_2490: Sistem için bugün herkes hem üretici hem de tüketici olarak,
      aboutus_2500: İki ucundan yakılmış bir mumdur.
      aboutus_2510: Neden mi, seve seve çalışırlar?
      aboutus_2520: Çünkü önce, 
      aboutus_2530: Sahip olmayı hayal ederler.
      aboutus_2540: Ev için çalışan baba, ailesiyle konforlu bir yaşama sahip olmayı hayal eder.
      aboutus_2550: Araba için çalışan genç erkek, arkadaşlarını gezdirdiğini hayal eder.
      aboutus_2560: Telefon için çalışan genç kız, fotoğraflarını paylaştığını hayal eder.
      aboutus_2570: Dikkat edin!
      aboutus_2580: Her hayal, aslında o şeye ulaştıktan sonra,
      aboutus_2590: Kişinin o nesneden alacağı hizmetlerin hayalidir.
      aboutus_2600: Hayal ettikleri,
      aboutus_2610: Sahip olacakları nesnenin verdiği hizmetin,
      aboutus_2620: Yaşamı zenginleştirmesidir sadece.
      aboutus_2630: İyi hissetmelerini sağlamasıdır.
      aboutus_2640: Hissi, hizmeti yaşamak verir.
      aboutus_2650: İşte bu his; 
      aboutus_2660: Adamı çalıştırtır.
      aboutus_2670: İşte bu his;
      aboutus_2680: Bağımlılık yapar.
      aboutus_2690: İşte bu his;
      aboutus_2700: İnsanlığı son 10bin yıldır ilerletiyor.
      aboutus_2710: Dünyadaki bütün para, kendini iyi hissetmek için harcanır.
      aboutus_2720: Nedir para?
      aboutus_2730: Ticaretin en eski takas olmuştur.
      aboutus_2740: Nihayietinde demir paralar ve kağıt paralar gelmiştir.
      aboutus_2750: Önce “Altın standardı” ile.
      aboutus_2760: Kişinin elineki 10 liralık kağıt para, 
      aboutus_2770: Devletin ona ödediği 10 liralık borç senedidir. 
      aboutus_2780: Devlet, “sen buna sahipsin” ibaresini,
      aboutus_2790: Paranın üzerindeki imzasıyla da onaylar.
      aboutus_2800: Çünkü devletin bu para karşılığında altını bulunmaktır.
      aboutus_2810: Böylelikle takas başka bir hal almış,
      aboutus_2820: İnsanlar ellerindeki altın hisselerini değiştirir olmuşlardır.
      aboutus_2830: Tabiki en sonunda,
      aboutus_2840: Bankalar aralarında anlaşmışlar,
      aboutus_2850: Dünya devletlerini ikna etmişler,
      aboutus_2860: Altın sistemi terk edilmiştir.
      aboutus_2870: İşte o günden beri; 
      aboutus_2880: Birilerinin canı sıkıldıkça,
      aboutus_2890: Para basılmaktadır.
      aboutus_2900: Altın sembolik hale gelmiştir.
      aboutus_2910: Gelmemiştir diyen de enayidir.
      aboutus_2920: Çünkü günümüzde artık para basmakla da uğraşmıyorlar.
      aboutus_2930: Artık para, bir bilgisayarın sıfırlı numalarıdır.
      aboutus_2940: Bir kendine güven biçimidir.
      aboutus_2950: Banka hesabınızdaki 10 liranın yanına,
      aboutus_2960: 10 sıfır eklendiğini farkederseniz,
      aboutus_2970: Kendinize güveniniz 10 ile çarpılır.
      aboutus_2980: Sonuçta;
      aboutus_2990: Para, bir semboldür.
      aboutus_3000: Neyin sembolüdür?
      aboutus_3010: Sadece,
      aboutus_3020: Ama Sadece,
      aboutus_3030: Harcanılan eforun.
      aboutus_3040: Efor göreceli olabilir.
      aboutus_3050: Cebinizdeki 10 lirayı, arkadaşınızla karşılıkı olarak,
      aboutus_3060: 10 milyon kere alıp verirseniz,
      aboutus_3070: 100 milyon lira kazanmış olursunuz.
      aboutus_3080: Harcanılan efor arkadaşınızı tanımak ve parayı 10 milyon kere değiştirmektir.
      aboutus_3090: Para, bu eforun sembölüdür.
      aboutus_3100: Efor fiziksel olmayabilir.
      aboutus_3110: Beynen en pis işlerde çalışanlara en yüksek paralar ödenir.
      aboutus_3120: Fiziksel olarak en pis işlerde çalışanlara da en düşük paralar.
      aboutus_3130: Efor geçmişte, şimdi ve gelecekte harcanılan;
      aboutus_3140: Zamanı temsil eder.
      aboutus_3150: Beynen en pis işte çalışan kişinin geçmişi o işle doludur.
      aboutus_3160: Bir ürünün el yapımı, fabrikasyon halinden her zaman daha pahalıdır.
      aboutus_3170: Ona milyonlar kazandıracak kişileri bulup anlaşmak iş adamı için kolay olmamıştır.
      aboutus_3180: Her durumda da;
      aboutus_3190: Kişi, yaşamından daha çok vermiştir. 
      aboutus_3200: Para, bu eforun sembolüdür.
      aboutus_3210: Paranın sembolik olduğunu biliyoruz.
      aboutus_3220: Peki efor nedir?
      aboutus_3230: İşte efor, hizmettir.
      aboutus_3240: Kişinin verdiği ve aldığı hizmetlerin toplamıdır efor.
      aboutus_3250: Hizmet önce paraya çevrilir.
      aboutus_3260: Ardından başka birinin harcadığı hizmet olan;
      aboutus_3270: Eve, arabaya, veya telefona;
      aboutus_3280: Geri çevrilir.
      aboutus_3290: Ekonomi derler buna.
      aboutus_3300: Her kişi, genlerinde yer etmiş hizmetleri sağlama özellikleriyle doğar.
      aboutus_3310: Yaşamı boyunca yeni hizmetler öğrenir.
      aboutus_3320: Çevresine hizmetler verir.
      aboutus_3330: Çevresinden hizmetler alır.
      aboutus_3340: Tüm bu hizmetler, onun yaşam tecrübesini belirler.
      aboutus_3350: Hayat derler buna.
      aboutus_3360: Doktor; sağlık hizmetlerinden sorumludur.
      aboutus_3370: Asker; güvenlik hizmetlerinden.
      aboutus_3380: Anne; ailesinin bakım, temizlik, beslenme hizmetleriyle uğraşır.
      aboutus_3390: Baba; ailesinin finans, güvenlik, ulaşım hizmetleri için didinir.
      aboutus_3400: Tüm bu hizmetlerin arkasındaki tek şey,
      aboutus_3410: Kişinin kendisini iyi hissetmesidir.
      aboutus_3420: Ama maddi, ama manevi. 
      aboutus_3430: Karşılıklı hizmetler sayesinde,
      aboutus_3440: Hem Ekonomi çarkı,
      aboutus_3450: Hem Hayat çarkı,
      aboutus_3460: Döner durur.
      aboutus_3470: Çoğu insan parayı bir mal, bir emtia olarak görür.
      aboutus_3480: Bunlar ekonomiye en zararlılarımız oldukları gibi,
      aboutus_3490: Hayat fakirleridirler.
      aboutus_3500: Çünkü parayı çevirmeye değil, toplamaya çalışırlar.
      aboutus_3510: Daha çok kazanmak yerine, tasarruf için uğraşırlar.
      aboutus_3520: İşletmek yerine, mal edinirler.
      aboutus_3530: Daha az hizmet alıp, daha az hizmet vermeye başlarlar.
      aboutus_3540: Bunları yaparken harcadıkları hayatlarıdır aslında.
      aboutus_3550: Ellerine verilmiş müthiş bir tabloyu yakarak ısınmaya çalışırlar.
      aboutus_3560: Neden mi?
      aboutus_3570: Enayilerdir de ondan.
      aboutus_3580: Parayı depolayarak,
      aboutus_3590: Mutluluğu da depolayacaklarını sanarlar.
      aboutus_3600: İyi hissetmeyi depolamaya kalkışırlar.
      aboutus_3610: Ve çuvallarlar.
      aboutus_3620: Mutlluluk sadece nörokimyasal bir reaksiyondur.
      aboutus_3630: Dış etkenleri beklemek yerine,
      aboutus_3640: Kendi içinizde, kendi isteğinizle yaratabilceğiniz bir durumdur.
      aboutus_3650: Hemen,
      aboutus_3660: Şimdi.
      aboutus_3670: Sadece sahip olduklarınıza şükrederek.
      aboutus_3680: Mutluluk için bir yerlere bişiler depolamaya gerek yoktur.
      aboutus_3690: Tam Tersine,
      aboutus_3700: Mutluluk;
      aboutus_3710: Denemek yanılmak. 
      aboutus_3720: Düşmek ve kalkmak. 
      aboutus_3730: Terkrar denemek,
      aboutus_3740: ve doğrusunu bulmaktır.
      aboutus_3750: Mutluluğu ararken,
      aboutus_3760: Bir şeyleri depolamaya çalışmak,
      aboutus_3770: Onu bulma özgürlüğünden alıkoyar sizi.
      aboutus_3780: Zenginler derler;
      aboutus_3790: Para elinin kiridir.
      aboutus_3800: Çok Doğrudur.
      aboutus_3810: Hizmetkutusu olarak,
      aboutus_3820: İşte burada devreye giriyoruz.
      aboutus_3830: Enayiler!
      aboutus_3840: Beleşi elinizdeyken,
      aboutus_3850: Aynısı için hizmet almak varken, 
      aboutus_3860: Bu sahip olma hırsından vazgeçin!
      aboutus_3870: Demekten kendimizi alıkoyamıyoruz.
      aboutus_3880: Hizmet alma ve Hizmet verme işini,
      aboutus_3890: Basitleştirirek,
      aboutus_3900: Yaygınlaştırarak,
      aboutus_3910: Kalitesini arttırarak,
      aboutus_3920: Makulleştirerek;
      aboutus_3930: İnsanların bilinçaltlarına,
      aboutus_3940: Satın almaktan önce,
      aboutus_3950: Hizmet almayı,
      aboutus_3960: Yerleştirmek istiyoruz.
      aboutus_3970: Çünkü insanları seviyoruz.
      aboutus_3980: Çünkü insanların toplumu,
      aboutus_3990: Toplumun da insanları değiştireceğini biliyoruz.
      aboutus_4000: Çünkü bir amaç uğrunda para kazanmak istiyoruz.
      aboutus_4010: Çünkü bize hizmet vermiş ülkemizin ekonomisine hizmet vermek istiyoruz.
      aboutus_4020: Çünkü hayatımızı anlamlı bir şekilde yaşamak istiyoruz.
      aboutus_4030: Dünyadaki bütün para, kendini iyi hissetmek için harcanmaktadır.
      aboutus_4040: O zaman niye şimdi iyi hissedilmiyor?
      aboutus_4050: 2 milyonluk ev için çalışan iş adamı;
      aboutus_4060: Neden o evi yıllık 60 bin liraya kiralayıp önce tercübe etmiyor?
      aboutus_4070: 30 binlik bir araba için çalışan memur;
      aboutus_4080: Neden lazım olduğunda 50 liraya o arabayı kiralamıyor?
      aboutus_4090: Yemeğin alışverişi, taşıması, ocağı, pişirmesi, tüp parası, bılaşığı ve su parasıyla uğraşan anne;
      aboutus_4100: Neden günlük 15 liraya bir restoranla anlaşıp koybolan emeği çocuğuna harcamıyor?
      aboutus_4110: Çamaşırın makinası, kurutması, ütüsü ve elektrik derdiyle uğraşan ev hanımı;
      aboutus_4120: Neden aylık 100 liraya  bu dertlerden kurtulmuyor?
      aboutus_4130: Niye insanlar ayda 1 kere olsun, saz veya gitar çalan birini,
      aboutus_4140: 100 liraya akşam yemeklerine davet etmiyorlar?
      aboutus_4150: Bunların hiçbiri için zengin olmaya gerek yok.
      aboutus_4160: Bir hesaplayın.
      aboutus_4170: Hesaba sizin emeğinizi katmaya da bilirsiniz.
      aboutus_4180: Daha ucuza geldiğini göreceksiniz.
      aboutus_4190: Daha kaliteli olacağını da göreceksiniz.
      aboutus_4200: Bir deneyin Bakalım.
      aboutus_4210: Görün.
      aboutus_4220: Yaşayın.
      aboutus_4230: İlla ki satın alacaksınız, 
      aboutus_4240: Yine satın alın, yine sahip olun, 
      aboutus_4250: Ama o ürünün verdiği hizmeti keşfettikten sonra.
      aboutus_4260: Çoğu zaman bir şeyi elde edene kadardır herşey.
      aboutus_4270: Ondan sonra sıkılmaya kadar geri sayım başlar.
      aboutus_4280: Bir çok ürün satın aldıktan sonra dert getirir, bakım maliyeti getirir.
      aboutus_4290: Evdeki hesap hiçbir zaman çarşıya uymaz.
      aboutus_4300: Satın almayıp, hizmet alarak;
      aboutus_4320: Hem daha kalitelisini alırsınız.
      aboutus_4330: Hem daha ucuza gelir.
      aboutus_4340: Hem ekonomi canlanır.
      aboutus_4350: Hem yaşamaya zaman kalır.
      aboutus_4360: Hizmetkutusu olarak,
      aboutus_4370: Kendimizden bir örnek verelim.
      aboutus_4380: Biz, hiçbirşeyi satın almadık.
      aboutus_4390: Hiçbirşeye sahip değiliz.
      aboutus_4400: Sadece hizmet alıyoruz.
      aboutus_4410: Ofis için A firmasından.
      aboutus_4420: Sunucu için B firmasından.
      aboutus_4430: Telefon için C firmasından.
      aboutus_4440: Satış için D firmasından.
      aboutus_4450: Araba için E firmasından.
      aboutus_4460: Finans için F firmasından.
      aboutus_4470: Yazılım için geri kalan tüm harflerden.
      aboutus_4480: Yaşamımıza bir bakın;
      aboutus_4490: Ev alacak paramız var,
      aboutus_4500: Ama evimiz hep kiralık;
      aboutus_4510: Sonbaharda İzmir için İzmir’in göbeğindeyiz.
      aboutus_4520: Kışın kar ve snowboard için Erciyes’in eteklerinde.
      aboutus_4530: Baharda doğa ve dağlar için marmaris civarında.
      aboutus_4540: Yazın günbatımı ve tekne için Çeşme kıyılarında.
      aboutus_4550: Yazın küçük bir tekne, 
      aboutus_4560: Kışın külüstür bir araba, 
      aboutus_4570: Baharda eski bir motorsiklet kiralarız.
      aboutus_4580: Yemek yapmayız,
      aboutus_4590: Ama hergün değişik ve lezzetli yemekler yeriz.
      aboutus_4600: Ev işiyle uraşmayız,
      aboutus_4610: Ama evimiz tertemiz ve düzenlidir.
      aboutus_4620: Zenginmiyiz?
      aboutus_4630: Evet çok zenginiz.
      aboutus_4640: Ama para zengini değil,
      aboutus_4650: Yaşam zenginiyiz.
      aboutus_4660: Hizmet almanın da,
      aboutus_4670: Buna direk katkısı var.
      aboutus_4680: Dikkat edin!
      aboutus_4690: Kendimizi hiçbirşeye bağlamıyoruz.
      aboutus_4700: Hizmet aldığımız için özgürüz.
      aboutus_4710: Bu nedenle aylağız.
      aboutus_4720: Çalışmıyoruz.
      aboutus_4730: Yaşıyoruz.
      aboutus_4740: Hiçbirşeyin derdini çekmiyoruz.
      aboutus_4750: Evet şirketimiz var.
      aboutus_4760: Ama sabah 7’de kalkıp trafiğe girmeye gerek yok.
      aboutus_4770: Evet evimiz var.
      aboutus_4780: Ama onun konumuyla, komşusuyla, bakımıyla, mirasıyla uğraşmak yok.
      aboutus_4790: Evet ailemiz var.
      aboutus_4800: Ama onlarla bir yere tıkılmaya gerek yok.
      aboutus_4810: Herkes hizmet alabilir mi?
      aboutus_4820: Alabilir.
      aboutus_4830: Alamaya dabilir.
      aboutus_4840: Çünkü her iş gibi, bu işin de bir sırrı var.
      aboutus_4850: Herşey bir hizmettir!
      aboutus_4860: Hiç CRM diye bir laf duydunuz mu?
      aboutus_4870: Duymadıysanız da, size hergün dokunduğundan eminiz.
      aboutus_4880: İngilizce “Customer Relationship Management”.
      aboutus_4890: Türkçe “Müşteri İlişkileri Yönetimi”.
      aboutus_4900: Bu gavur terimi, 
      aboutus_4910: Vallahi çok gereksizdir.
      aboutus_4920: Amacı şudur;
      aboutus_4930: Hizmeti alanla hizmeti veren arasındaki ilişkinin
      aboutus_4940: Profesyonel bir biçimde devam ettirilmesi.
      aboutus_4950: Çünkü bu ilişki devam ederse, hizmet satışı devam edecektir.
      aboutus_4960: Doğrudur,
      aboutus_4970: Ama profesyonel olmaz.
      aboutus_4980: Ve enayice yaparlar.
      aboutus_4990: Evet CRM size hergün dokunur.
      aboutus_5000: Cep telefonlarınıza gelen,
      aboutus_5010: O bir türlü engelleyemediğiniz reklamlar,
      aboutus_5020: Birer CRM’dir. 
      aboutus_5030: “Kış ürünlerinde %50 indirimi kaçırmayın..”
      aboutus_5040: “Size özel düşük faizli ihtiyaç kredimizle..”
      aboutus_5050: Bazen küçük rüşvetler de vermeyi de bilirler.
      aboutus_5060: “Doğum gününüzü kutlar, size sağlıklı...”
      aboutus_5070: “Mubarek kadir geceniz...”
      aboutus_5080: Ne kadar da yavandırlar.
      aboutus_5090: Sanarlar ki siz o şirkete daha da bağlanacaksınız.
      aboutus_5100: Enayilerdir. Çünkü durum bu değildir.
      aboutus_5110: Gerçek müşteri ilişkileri yönetimi nedir biliyor musunuz?
      aboutus_5120: Bakkal Hasan amcaya gitiğinizde;
      aboutus_5130: “Nasılsınız Mehmet bey, çoluk çocuk nasıl inşallah...”
      aboutus_5140: diye selamlaması.
      aboutus_5150: “Bak ne dicem..Kars’dan yeni peynir geldi, tam senin seveceğin cinsten..
      aboutus_5160: akşam ara sıra sofra kuruyosun hani al dolabında bulunsun”
      aboutus_5170: Demesidir.
      aboutus_5180: İşte kalite budur.
      aboutus_5190: Tanıdığının seni bilerek sana verdiği referanstır.
      aboutus_5200: İşte makul fiyat budur.
      aboutus_5210: Böyle bir sohbette fiyat konuşulmaz.
      aboutus_5220: Fiyat zaten olması gerekendir.
      aboutus_5230: Neyse alınır.
      aboutus_5240: Hasan amca seni bilir, sen onu bilirsin
      aboutus_5250: Başka bakkala da gitmezsin.
      aboutus_5260: Hizmetkutusu olarak,
      aboutus_5270: Her işiniz düştüğünde bize gelmenizi istemiyoruz.
      aboutus_5280: Biliyoruz ki belli başlı hizmet ihtiyaçlarınız var.
      aboutus_5290: Bizi kullanarak,
      aboutus_5300: Bu ihtiyaçları sürekli giderebilmeniz için,
      aboutus_5310: Kaliteli ve makul fiyata hizmet veren,
      aboutus_5320: Bakkal Hasan amcaları bulmanızı istiyoruz.
      aboutus_5330: Çünkü kaliteli hizmeti, makul fiyata almıyorsanız,
      aboutus_5340: O hizmeti almayın ve kendiniz uğraşın daha iyi!
      aboutus_5350: Evet bu konuda iddalıyız.
      aboutus_5360: Çünkü; 
      aboutus_5370: Biz de Hizmetkutusu kullanıyoruz,
      aboutus_5380: Biz de o bakkal Hasan amcaları bulmak istiyoruz.
      aboutus_5390: Gelecek kış Erzurum’a snowboard yapmaya gidelim diyoruz.
      aboutus_5400: Ev lazım.
      aboutus_5410: Araç lazım.
      aboutus_5420: Takım taklavat lazım.
      aboutus_5430: Yiyecek lazım.
      aboutus_5440: Giyecek lazım.
      aboutus_5450: Ne oraya gidip sokak sokak gezmeye,
      aboutus_5460: Ne deli danalar gibi sayısız kez googlemaya,
      aboutus_5470: Ne de sarı sayfaları karıştırmaya,
      aboutus_5480: Ne rakipleri kullanarak uzun formlar doldurmaya,
      aboutus_5490: Ne de sorup soruşturmaya halimiz var.
      aboutus_5500: Gireriz Hizmetkutusuna,
      aboutus_5510: Yazarız adrese Erzurum diye,
      aboutus_5520: Seçeriz ne istediğimizi
      aboutus_5530: Haberdar ederiz beyendiğimizi.
      aboutus_5540: Oh..bizde keyfimize bakalım.
      aboutus_5550: Yeni hayallerde kendimizi bulalım.
      aboutus_5560: Telefon etsinler!
      aboutus_5570: Sohbet edelim.
      aboutus_5580: Ne öyle epostalar, web sitesi üzerinen mesajlaşmalar?
      aboutus_5590: Adam telefonda kendisini anlatmasını beceremiyorsa,
      aboutus_5600: İşimizi nasıl becerecek?
      aboutus_5610: Bakalım, Erzurum’daki bakkal Hasan amcalarımızı bulabilecek miyiz..
      aboutus_5620: Çünkü bulduğumuzda, artık rahatız.
      aboutus_5630: Bu dünyada iki tip insan vardır.
      aboutus_5640: Birinci tipler fırsatların önlerine gelmesini,
      aboutus_5650: Ve önlerine gelmesi yetmiyormuş gibi,  
      aboutus_5660: Bu fırsatları yakalayacaklarından da emin olmak isterler.
      aboutus_5670: Köşelerinde otururlar, beklerler.
      aboutus_5680: Onlar fırsatı yakalayım derken,
      aboutus_5690: Hayat önlerinden akıp geçer.
      aboutus_5700: İkinci tip insanlarsa,
      aboutus_5710: Sorgusuz sualsiz fırsata giderler,
      aboutus_5720: Kendi fırsatlarını kendileri yaratırlar.
      aboutus_5730: Kendi şanslarını kendilerler belirlerler.
      aboutus_5740: Hizmetkutusu yepyeni bir fikir değildir.
      aboutus_5750: Olmasına da gerek yoktur.
      aboutus_5760: Çünkü kökeni cilalı taş devrine dayanır.
      aboutus_5770: Türkiye’de ve yurtdışında da benzerleri de vardır.
      aboutus_5780: Farklı olduğumuz nokta şu;
      aboutus_5790: İnsan piskolojisini kullanarak,
      aboutus_5800: Kaliteli hizmeti makul fiyata sunmaya çalışıyoruz.
      aboutus_5810: Nasıl mı?
      aboutus_5820: Hizmetkutusundan seçtiğiniz hizmet sağlayıcıları haberdar ettiğinizde,
      aboutus_5830: Cep telefonlarına bir mesajı düşer.
      aboutus_5840: “A km uzakta olan B kişisi sizden C konusunda hizmet almak istiyor.
      aboutus_5850: Bu kişi sizi D. sırada seçti ve profili E.
      aboutus_5860: Kişinin cep telefonuna erişmek istiyorsanız EVET yazınız.”
      aboutus_5870: EVET yazdığında hizmet sağlayıcının hesabından 1TL düşüyoruz.
      aboutus_5880: Dikkat ederseniz hizmet sağlayıcının önüne fırsatı getiriyoruz.
      aboutus_5890: Şunu biliyoruz;
      aboutus_5900: Bahsettiğimiz birinci tip insanlar bu fırsatı kabul etmeyecekler.
      aboutus_5910: Çünkü onlardan hizmet almayı kabul etmeyebilirsiniz.
      aboutus_5920: İsterler ki, garanti olan işi önlerine getirelim. 
      aboutus_5930: İsterler ki, işin olacağını görsünler sonra para versinler.
      aboutus_5940: Şunu da biliyoruz;
      aboutus_5950: Bahsettiğimiz ikinci tip insanlar bu işi kabul edecekler.
      aboutus_5960: Çünkü bulundukları konuma bu şekilde gelmişlerdir.
      aboutus_5970: Kendilerine güvenerek,
      aboutus_5980: Risk alarak.
      aboutus_5990: İşte sizin ve bizim ikinci tip insanlara ihtiyacımız var.
      aboutus_6000: Bakkal Hasan amcalar bunlardır.
      aboutus_6010: Bu kişi laf değil, iş yapar.
      aboutus_6020: Başınızı ağrıtmaz.
      aboutus_6030: İşini kaliteli yapar.
      aboutus_6040: Bedelini de alır.
      aboutus_6050: Çoğu zaman da bu bedel bir iş beceremeyenle aynıdır.
      aboutus_6060: Sonuçta;
      aboutus_6070: Kalitelidir dersiniz.
      aboutus_6080: Makuldür dersiniz.
      aboutus_6090: Tesisatçı mı lazım.
      aboutus_6100: Çağırın Ahmet ustayı!
      aboutus_6110: Bu kişi ailenizden biri olmalı.
      aboutus_6120: Sizinle yemek yemeli.
      aboutus_6130: Çocuğunuzun büyüdüğünü görmeli.
      aboutus_6140: Paranız olmadığında veresiye kabul etmeli.
      aboutus_6150: Zevk için pazarlık yapabilmelisiniz.
      aboutus_6160: Zırt pırt değiştirilmez böyle insanlar!
      aboutus_6170: Şirket çalışanısınız diyelim. Amirinize sorumlusunuz. Taşeron lazım.
      aboutus_6180: En son isteyeceğiniz şey bulduğunuzun işleri berbat etmesidir.
      aboutus_6190: İşler bir berbat oldu mu;
      aboutus_6200: Patronuz o teşeronu anlamaz,
      aboutus_6210: Sizin o işi becemediğinizi anlar.
      aboutus_6220: Birine işi verdiğinizde ona güvenebilmeli ve hep onla çalışabilmelisiniz.
      aboutus_6230: Kaça yaparsın diye danışabilmeli ,
      aboutus_6240: Her durumda telefonla arayabilmelisiniz.
      aboutus_6250: Böyle insalarla çalışmıştırsınız.
      aboutus_6255: Bu kişileri ısmarlama bulamazsınız.
      aboutus_6260: Bu kişileri tesadüf eseri bulursunuz.
      aboutus_6270: Bir olasılıktır.
      aboutus_6280: Hizmetkutusu olarak,
      aboutus_6290: Bu olasılığı en yüksek seviyeye taşıyoruz.
